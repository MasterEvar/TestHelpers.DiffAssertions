    <description>
      A simple diff comparison asserter that makes it easy to assert if two texts (strings) are equal, and display the differences in a diff tool if they are not.
      Simply put it is a much simpler (and dumber) version of ApprovalTests that should get the job done for simple scenarios.
      You can easily create a file that contains the expected result (your specification or example) and then compare the contents of the file with the actual value that is produced during the test.
